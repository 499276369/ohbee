This is a skeleton for developing equip2/Spring web applications.  The aim
of having this skeleton is to minimise the setup required for creating
a new equip2 webapp.

doc - Documentation folder

src - Java/AspectJ source folder, put your sources in here and they will be
included in the ant build process.

etc - This folder contains configuration files for the application.

	etc/bean2java.xsd - XML schema for equip2 bean xml files.
	
	etc/config.properties - The application configuration file, you should edit this
	file to configure your application.
	
	etc/types - Place your XML type definitions in this folder to have the Java types
	and Hibernate mapping files automtically generated by the build script.
	
	etc/resources - This folder contains application resources that do not need altering under most
	circumstances, be sure you know what you are doing before changing anything in
	here!
	
		etc/resources/configuration.jsp - A skeleton file for configuring the dataspace viewer JSP
		pages.  This skeleton file will be used to automatically generate the
		final configuration during the build process.
		
		etc/resources/equip2.spring.db.NextID.xml - XML type definition for a simple type used to 
		force Hibernate to create a table for the nextID function.
		
		etc/resources/NextID.hbm.xml - Custom Hibernate mapping file containing the nextID function.

lib - This folder contains the library dependencies needed by an equip2 web 
application.  You should place the library dependencies for your application
in this folder to have them automatically included in the build process.  You
may swap any of the libraries for different versions though be aware when doing
so that you may break the equip2 application.
The servlet-api.jar (version 2.5) is included as a compilation dependency
but will not be copied into your web application by the build process as the 
application server should provide its own version.  You may wish to exchange
this version for your application servers version to minimise any version
mismatch. 

webapp - This directory is the root of the web application, your web application files
should be built up in this directory.

	webapp/css - CSS file directory.
	
	webapp/css/dsviewer.css - CSS file for the dataspace viewer pages, you can change this
	if you want. 
	
	webapp/WEB-INF - Standard web application WEB-INF folder.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/jsp - Your JSP files should go in here.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/tld - Your type library definitions should go in here.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml - Spring application context configuration file, this
	already contains the necessary configuration for a basic equip2 web application
	but you should extend for your application.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/db-servlet.xml - Spring configuration for the dataspace viewer, you
	should probably leave this alone unless you know what you are doing.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/log4j.properties - Basic log4j configuration file, edit to your needs.
	
	webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml - Standard servlet web.xml file, you will need to edit this 
	as you develop your application.
	
	webapp/index.html - A very basic greeting page that you will probably want to change.

build.properties - This contains the build configuration, you should edit
this file before starting the build process.

build.xml - Ant buildfile, contains all of the targets for building the 
web application.  You should not generally need to edit this file.  The
default target 'dist' creates a distribution war file in the dist folder.
Use the target 'help' for more information on targets.
